Be sure to load tidyverse into library in order to use tibble tool

``` r
library(tidyverse)
```

## Problem 1

Create a data frame comprised of:

  - a random sample of size 10 from a standard Normal distribution
  - a logical vector indicating whether elements of the sample are
    greater than 0
  - a character vector of length 10
  - a factor vector of length 10, with 3 different factor “levels”

<!-- end list -->

``` r
prob1_df =
    tibble(
      samp = rnorm(10),
      samp_gt_0 = samp > 0,
      char_vec = c("a", "b", "c", "d", "e", "f", "g", "h", "i", "j"),
      factor_vec = factor(c("low", "low", "low", "mod", "mod", "mod", "mod","high", "high", "high"))
    )
```

Try to take the mean of each variable:

What worked and what didn’t work?

Variable Worked | Variable did not work
\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_
|\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ | |

## Problem 2

You can also embed plots, for example:

![](p8105_HW1_rkm2147_files/figure-gfm/pressure-1.png)<!-- -->

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to
prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
